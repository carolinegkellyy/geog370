            <h1>Homework 7: Electric Vehicle/Hybrid Vehicle Registration across Europe</h1> 
            <h2> By Caroline Kelly </h2> 
            <h3>I present a EV/Hybrid car map since I'm an Environmental Studies major 
                who's interested energy consumption across nation's. There's a very high EV/Hybrid rate 
                per capita within Europe, one of the largest in the world. I wanted to compare nation's 
                in Europe and draw potential conclusions into why some nations have far more EV/Hybrid 
                registrations than others. Electrification of vehicles is a crucial step in combatting climate 
                change since there are zero net tailpipe emmissions of harmful air pollutants, like nitrogen
                oxide. In many ways, Europe can act as a blue print for a future economic shift within the 
                United States from gas consuming vehicles to more electrified ones. The data used for this project
                was collected from EuroStat.

            <h1>Homework 6 Part 1: Census Data Choropleth </h1> 
            <h2> By Caroline Kelly </h2> 
            <h3> I present a SNAP Benefit Usage map across North Carolina counties. SNAPS Benefits are 
                supplemental food assitance for those who fall below a certain income threshold. I'm a Food
                Studies minor and one of the courses I'm enrolled in this semester is centered around food politics. 
                The importance of supplemental assitance, like SNAP Benefits, was illuminated during the 
                COVID-19 pandemic. I thought a choropleth map sharing the usage of SNAP Benefits in North Carolina
                would help illuminate the prevalence, thus initiating destigmatization of those who need 
                this additional help. </h3>

            <h3> The first map is a natural breaks map that shows the difference in total households in a county 
                vs the amount of households in a county that receive SNAP Benefits. Natural breaks are where 
                attributes are divided into classes whose boundaries are set within large differences in data.

            <h3>The second map is an  map that shows the difference in total households in a county 
                vs the amount of households in a county that receive SNAP Benefits. Equal interval divides attributes
                into equal size ranges. This method divides attribute values into equal size ranges.</h3>

            <h3>The third map is an equal count map that shows the difference in total households in a county 
                vs the amount of households in a county that receive SNAP Benefits. Equal count groups the same 
            count of features in each of the five classes.</h3>

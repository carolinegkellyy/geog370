            <h1>Homework 6: Census Data Choropleth </h1> 
            <h2> By Caroline Kelly </h2> 
            <h3> I present a SNAP Benefit Usage map across North Carolina counties. SNAPS Benefits are 
                supplemental food assitance for those who fall below a certain income threshold. I'm a Food
                Studies minor and one of the courses I'm enrolled in this semester is centered around food politics. 
                The importance of supplemental assitance, like SNAP Benefits, was illuminated during the 
                COVID-19 pandemic. I thought a choropleth map sharing the usage of SNAP Benefits in North Carolina
                would help illuminate the prevalence, thus initiating destigmatization of those who need 
                this additional help. </h3>

    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>For Homework 3, I used three different platforms to create the final 
        product: QGIS, GitHub and VS Code. With the zip file provided 
        containing data from Natural Earth, I uploaded base layers to 
        QGIS to demonstrate differences in projections. Using the Indatrix 
        mapper plugin, constant radius ellipsoidal caps were able to 
        demonstrate to me types of distortion that can occur with projections. 
        I then created print layers for each of the required projections to display 
        projection title and EPSG. Map files were then transferred to my dev 
        file, specifically created for GEOG370. It was once these files were 
        uploaded that I could work via VS Code to format the text, content and 
        images for the GitHub page.

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>WGS84 is represented as an ellipsoid. It's one of the more common
        models used in geography to display landmasses, however, it has a 
        drawback with distorting shape of land at the poles. The equator 
        and land around that latitude are fairly accurate.

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>Aitoff projections are not equal-area, resulting in some distortion 
        in area and shape. There's also differences in distance between 
        landmasses. Scale is in tact for the equator/central meridian.

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>Psuedo-Mercator projections are beneficial in their ability to 
        limit distortion with preserving elements of the equator and 
        is more advantageous for representing distance than several 
        other forms of projection. However, the size of landmasses become
        greatly distorted. For example, Greenland appears to be around 
        the same size as Africa, when in reality this is not the case. </h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel-I</h2>
    <h3>Winkel-I projections are typically used as world maps since 
        they are non-conformal and non-equal area. This creates distortion 
        with area and shape. Generally speaking, scale remains true in 
        selection latitudes. </h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical</h2>
    <h3>With cylindrical projections, the equators are almost always 
        true to the actual latitude. Shape of landmasses at the poles 
        are distorted leading to increased areas among countries like 
        Canada and Russia.

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>World Equidistant Conic projections are commonly used to map 
        smaller landmass countries and lands elongated east to west. 
        This projection type is beneficial in that distances along 
        meridians are typically true. However, shape is distorted as you 
        move towards the south pole.

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant projections use the polar aspect 
        to project straight lines originating at a given pole. In 
        appearance, North Pole Azimuthal is similar to World Equidistant 
        since both distort shape at the opposite pole. Distance is mostly
        preserved. It's also the map used for the United Nation's seal!

    <h2>African Sinusoidal</h2>
    <h3>African Sinusoidal projections are pseudocylindrical and 
        equal-area. The poles are represented as points, like how they 
        would be on a sphere. However, landmasses are distorted as you 
        move further away from the true meridian and prime meridian. 
        With the landmasses near the poles, shape and area tends to be 
        distorted.

    <h2>World Polyconic</h2>
    <h3>World Polyconic projects are non-conformal and non equal-area. 
        This created distortion with shape, area and distance. However, 
        the central meridian is accurate along with the scale along that 
        line. Distortion increases from the equator of the map to the 
        poles.

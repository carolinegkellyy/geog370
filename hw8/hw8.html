            <h1>Homework 8: Proximity of Brownfield Sites to Endangered Woodstork Nest Colonies</h1> 
            <h2> By Caroline Kelly </h2> 
            <h3>I decided to focus on brownfield sites, which are plots of land that have been deemed potentially 
                hazardous for future construction projects or further development due to exposure to chemicals or 
                waste. It's recommended to maintain at least a 1.8 mile distance from brownfield sites
                to experience zero risk of negative health externalities, with both humans and animals. 
                I decided to look further into an endangered avian species, the Woodstork, and see if their 
                endangerment is correlated with their nesting colonies' proximity to brownfield sites. 
                
                There were 8 nesting colonies within the 1.8 mile buffer I created using principles of 
                geoprocessing. I further used the geoprocessing principle of intersection, creating a visual 
                intersection of the sites within the buffer. While these findings are correlative for now, 
                they suggest a potential need for further research on the impact of brownfield's hazardous 
                health impacts and avian species.

                I also queued data from a csv to help approximate the polygons used to signify to the viewer the 
                brownfield sites. One of the most accredited reasons for Woodstork population decide is the factor 
                of ecosystem loss and
